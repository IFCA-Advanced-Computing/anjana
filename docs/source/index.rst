ANJANA
=============================================================================

ANJANA is a `Python`_ library which allows the application of different anonymity
techiniques based on a set of identifiers, quasi-identifiers (QI) and a sensitive 
attribute. It's easy to use and fast. 
The following anonymity techniques can be applied:

* k-anonymity.
* (:math:`\alpha`,k)-anonymity.
* :math:`\ell`-diversity.
* Entropy :math:`\ell`-diversity.
* Recursive (c, :math:`\ell`)-diversity.
* t-closeness.
* Basic :math:`\beta`-likeness.
* Enhanced :math:`\beta`-likeness.
* :math:`\delta`-disclosure privacy.
