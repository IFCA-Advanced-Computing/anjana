Multiple sensitive attributes
#############################

.. note::
   Currently, ANJANA allows the incorporation of a single sensitive attribute (SA) for the anonymization process with the different techniques implemented. If you have more than one SA, we recommend you to apply the desired technique with respect to the first SA, and once the anonymized dataset is obtained, anonymize it again with respect to another of the sensitive attributes, and so on. In addition, if it is considered that any of the sensitive attributes can act as a quasi-identifier for the rest of the sensitive attributes, it can be included as QI when applicable.
